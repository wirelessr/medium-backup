But then, for various reasons, we started to build AWS data stacks, so we need to use S3 and Redshift, etc. In fact, all three public clouds have similar roles in data engineering.</p><p name="238c" id="238c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, in the three major public clouds, there are similar roles in data engineering responsible for the corresponding functions.</p><p name="1ed9" id="1ed9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we are looking for relational databases, AWS has RDS, Azure has SQL Database, and Cloud SQL is also available on GCP. If we are looking for object storage services, AWS has the famous S3, Azure also has Blob storage, and GCP also has GCS.</p><p name="eeb1" id="eeb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we are looking for a common data warehouse, AWS has Redshift, Azure can use Synapase to deal with it, and GCP also has the famous BigQuery. Even the specialized catalog service for data engineering, there is Glue on AWS, and Azure and GCP also have the corresponding Data Catalog.</p><p name="ef3d" id="ef3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Arguably, all three public clouds are competitive with each other. While some services have common protocols that can be migrated to each other, such as RDS and SQL Database, which can be migrated almost seamlessly based on the same implementations.</p><p name="d5c7" id="d5c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, other services, such as object storage, are not as simple to migrate. As a result, the data services built on the three public clouds have become data silos for each other.</p><p name="c406" id="c406" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, with the rise of AI in recent years, many organizations have started to build their own AI/ML technical stacks. Unlike the technical stacks used in data engineering, AI/ML technical stacks are basically fully independent, such as feature stores and vector databases. These infrastructures also have their own data, but it is difficult to integrate with the existing stacks.</p><p name="8e17" id="8e17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The following is a complete data infra and a complete AI/ML infra.</p><figure name="e8be" id="e8be" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*_uK72KG9Ua9uskSl.png" data-width="2000" data-height="1236" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_uK72KG9Ua9uskSl.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/" data-href="https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/</a></figcaption></figure><figure name="e06b" id="e06b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*8jsd-ixoAWwHzJvc.png" data-width="2000" data-height="1406" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*8jsd-ixoAWwHzJvc.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/" data-href="https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="d54f" id="d54f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">From the above two diagrams, we can figure out that these two groups of technical stacks are independent of each other, i.e. two silos.</p><h3 name="eeb3" id="eeb3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Data Lakehouse</h3><p name="4b7e" id="4b7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After understanding the root cause of data silos, the next question is how to solve it.</p><p name="1efb" id="1efb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most straightforward idea is to centralize the management of all data, which is a typical data lakehouse, and Databricks was the first to propose this idea.</p><p name="36eb" id="36eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In analytics scenarios, structured data is often used, while AI/ML scenarios rely heavily on unstructured data. For data lakehouses, both structured and unstructured data can be centrally managed.</p><p name="e953" id="e953" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition, data lakehouse provides a common interface for various processing engines, such as Spark and Flink for stream processing and Trino for big data querying. Thanks to the multi-engine support, data lakehouse can be applied to almost every data scenario.</p><figure name="a359" id="a359" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*R3nXVSFEc3jNik1C.png" data-width="832" data-height="1024" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*R3nXVSFEc3jNik1C.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/05/19/evolution-to-the-data-lakehouse.html" data-href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/05/19/evolution-to-the-data-lakehouse.html" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/05/19/evolution-to-the-data-lakehouse.html</a></figcaption></figure><p name="8484" id="8484" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Moreover, data lakehouses provide an cost and performance balance. It can support a variety of usage scenarios while at the same time saving costs. Of course, this is an advantage traded for performance.</p><p name="9530" id="9530" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nevertheless, data lakehouses still don’t totally solve everything, such as the following problems.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="56e4" id="56e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">At the sacrifice of performance, user-facing feature still requires dedicated database support.</li><li name="5088" id="5088" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Unified data storage is a challenge for privacy and compliance.</li><li name="9bea" id="9bea" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The data is all put together and still can’t avoid the dilemma of data swamp which is the result of the data lake in the past. Although there is a catalog in the data lakehouse, it is still not transparent enough.</li></ul><p name="99e4" id="99e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Most importantly, although the data lakehouse effectively mitigate the gap between data engineering and AI/ML, it is still helpless in cross public cloud scenarios.</p><h3 name="53a7" id="53a7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Metadata Lake</h3><p name="e8ca" id="e8ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The problem we face now is the storage everywhere, and each type of storage has its own catalog, and each catalog is heterogeneous.</p><p name="157b" id="157b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What if we treat the catalog as we treat the data? In other words, just as we gather all the data in one place, we gather all the catalogs in one place, so can we achieve complete governance? When we can completely govern all the data with metadata, won’t we break the data silo?</p><p name="bae9" id="bae9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, exactly. This is what the concept of metadata lake does.</p><figure name="d931" id="d931" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*McVvNYc63-tTeZuNOYlZ1g.png" data-width="1156" data-height="666" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*McVvNYc63-tTeZuNOYlZ1g.png"></figure><p name="ab37" id="ab37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">From the above diagram, we can see modern data processing engines have corresponding catalogs, and Metadata Lake is designed to centralize the governance of these catalogs. In this way, there is a unified place to view all data sources and understand the internal data structure.</p><p name="eac7" id="eac7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This concept is not new, in fact, all public clouds have launched corresponding products, like Microsoft’s OneLake and GCP’s BigLake, which are based on this concept.</p><p name="08da" id="08da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, these public cloud services can only solve the data silos within the public cloud, and there is still no solution for cross public cloud.</p><p name="f960" id="f960" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fortunately, more and more enterprises have noticed this business opportunity and started to make their own products, e.g., Datastrato’s <a href="https://datastrato.ai/docs/0.5.0/" data-href="https://datastrato.ai/docs/0.5.0/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gravitino</a> is focused on solving the data silos across clouds.</p><h3 name="373d" id="373d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="a0ac" id="a0ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We are living in a chaotic and complex era.</p><p name="2e27" id="2e27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The amount of data is exploding, and the AI boom is exacerbating the process. In the past, we have tried to store data, clean it, transform it, and then use it. With the data we have, we’re already swamped. And with the increasing data volume, it’s only getting busier.</p><p name="c9ac" id="c9ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, nowadays, this is not enough. We want to know what is stored and we want to be able to integrate and interact with it easily. Therefore, data governance has become an obvious subject.</p><p name="ce4e" id="ce4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s also why there’s an increasing number of tools geared towards metadata.</p><p name="2345" id="2345" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I’m also concerned about this topic because our organization recently made the transition from GCP to AWS, and governing the warehouse schema for both clouds is becoming an issue. I will leave this story for later, so let’s call it a day.</p></div></div></section>
