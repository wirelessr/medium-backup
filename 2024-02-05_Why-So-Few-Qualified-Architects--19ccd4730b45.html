But I have always had one question in my mind: why is it so hard to find candidates who meet the expectations?</p><p name="d2c9" id="d2c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recently, after reading <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068" data-href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a study</a>, I was able to answer this question in a more systematic way. The topic of this study is: Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure.</p><p name="575e" id="575e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is also the 2022 Ig Informal Lecture for the Economics Prize.</p><figure name="67cd" id="67cd" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b_PmltdoGgY?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="4d86" id="4d86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Before we explain the connection between the architect’s difficulty in finding and this study, let’s quickly summarise the study.</p><p name="3ee8" id="3ee8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To make a long story short, a person’s success has nothing to do with talent, but only with luck. To put it further, “Success is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1%</strong> genius and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">99%</strong> luck”.</p><p name="f8c2" id="f8c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Thomas Edison</em> told us that genius is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1%</strong> inspiration and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">99%</strong> perspiration. In other words, to be successful, effort is only <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">0.99%</strong>.</p><p name="d16f" id="d16f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why are so few candidates qualified to be architects?</p><p name="4677" id="4677" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because being an architect is not something you can do just by working hard, it’s very much a matter of chance.</p><h3 name="b9cf" id="b9cf" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Wait, that’s a bit arbitrary, isn’t it?</h3><p name="24e7" id="24e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In fact, every single one of those interviewed was a good senior engineer — yes, every single one.</p><p name="876a" id="876a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They all excel in their positions and have a good grasp of what they are responsible for. Even a team leader or manager who hadn’t actually written code in a long time still had a deep understanding of the service they were working on.</p><p name="8425" id="8425" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, these candidates were eliminated.</p><p name="55d3" id="55d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason was simple: not enough experience. Yes, I agree that they can all fully handle one or a few microservices. But the volume of these microservices was just not there, either because they lacked the volume of traffic and high-frequency reads and writes, or because they lacked the complexity and interaction with other systems.</p><p name="1721" id="1721" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This kind of experience is no match for an architect of a high-volume e-commerce platform.</p><p name="f729" id="f729" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Did you notice a key point? They all do their jobs well or even brilliantly, but they are still inexperienced.</p><h3 name="4c17" id="4c17" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Specialist vs. Generalist</h3><p name="8d2e" id="8d2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is actually the difference between I-shaped talents and T-shaped talents, i.e. Specialist and Generalist.</p><p name="9b26" id="9b26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you want to become a qualified architect, it is not enough just to do a good job. But to be honest, even if you work very hard, you may not be qualified. As I mentioned at the beginning, whether you can become an architect or not is mostly a matter of luck.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0d4b" id="0d4b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">If you are lucky enough to have worked for a large enterprise, then there is a little more possibility.</li><li name="cc53" id="cc53" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If, luckily, the company is willing to invest in various training, then there are more possibilities.</li><li name="3dec" id="3dec" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If you are lucky enough to have friendships with architects, then you have a little more possibilities.</li></ul><p name="2499" id="2499" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Can’t we learn the skills we should have by our own efforts?</p><p name="4fe5" id="4fe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, but it’s really hard.</p><p name="a13c" id="a13c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you don’t see how wide the world is, you can’t imagine what you need to learn.</p><p name="7b2a" id="7b2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is a Chinese idiom, “Frog in the bottom of a well”. A frog who lives in a well all his life cannot know the outside world.</p><p name="f58d" id="f58d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back to the architect’s perspective, let’s look at a few real-world examples.</p><p name="7657" id="7657" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do you know you need to learn caching if a system works well with one database and one API service?</p><p name="7c03" id="7c03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do you know you need to learn sharding if the amount of data can always be carried by a single database?</p><p name="e638" id="e638" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do you know you need to learn message queuing if the logic of the system is simple and can be responded in a short time?</p><p name="d252" id="d252" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More specifically, if a system does not have any search requirement, how do you know you need to learn Elasticsearch?</p><p name="8c51" id="8c51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All these are the vision that an architect needs to have, so do you know why most of the time you need to rely on “luck”?</p><h3 name="15fe" id="15fe" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Even so</h3><p name="9f6c" id="9f6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There are still possibilities for us to try our best.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="bbcb" id="bbcb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Read more books.</li><li name="b441" id="b441" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Attend more seminars.</li><li name="58e8" id="58e8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Visit more blogs.</li></ul><p name="69c9" id="69c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Even if we don’t know what’s missing, we can still become what we want to be by learning through various channels.</p><p name="c247" id="c247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Architects are on a never-ending journey of learning.</p><h3 name="e310" id="e310" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="cd4d" id="cd4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We’ve talked a lot about what it takes to be an architect, and explained why it’s so hard to find a qualified candidate, but I have to say that being an architect is just one of the “choices” in a career.</p><p name="da0d" id="da0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It doesn’t mean an architect is superior, it doesn’t mean an architect is invincible, and it doesn’t mean an architect is better than a senior engineer.</p><p name="0796" id="0796" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If learning is your hobby, then architect is a good choice.</p><p name="0612" id="0612" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But a senior software developer is also a good choice.</p></div></div></section>
